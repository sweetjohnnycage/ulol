# 3. Team Management and Roster Rules

## 3.1 Roster Size
Teams will be required to have six eligible players on its roster at all times.  There are no restrictions on position or designation of starter or substitute.

## 3.2 Roster Listing
The Active Roster will be displayed on an official competition website, to be shared publicly with teams. The Active Roster on that website will be updated upon proper filing of documentation. Once an acquisition is confirmed, the acquisition will be placed on the website. The Active Roster on that website will be considered the most up to date roster that could be applied within a reasonable time. Roster eligibility is still at the discretion of NACC officials.

## 3.3 Team Manager
Each team must also designate a Team Manager, who may be but does not need to be a player on the Active Roster. The Manager will be the primary point of contact for all NACC officials, and will also be the signatory authority for any documents which cause changes to the Active Roster, as outlined in [Section 3.3](#33-team-manager) and [3.4](#34-manager-overrule). The manager must be identified before the start of the Series, and a successor must be immediately identified if the Manager leaves the team (for any reason). The manager must be fully eligible in accordance with Sections [1.2.3](#123-riot-disciplinary-status) and [1.3](#13-no-riot-employees).

## 3.4 Manager Overrule
At the sole discretion of NACC officials, team managers may be overruled or replaced due to negligence, malice, or other reasonable suspicion of malfeasance.

## 3.5 Substitutes
Teams may freely play any 5 players from their roster at any time without any notification or approval process.

## 3.6 Acquisitions
A team may only acquire new players if a player is removed from their roster, per [Section 3.1](#31-roster-size).  Any new players must be fully eligible per [Section 1](#1-competition-eligibility).  If a team wishes to acquire a new player, that acquisition must be declared to a NACC official more than 3 full days before the game where the player would be utilized (e.g. if the next match is on Friday, a new player must be declared no later than Monday). NACC officials reserve the right to approve or deny any such request, based upon the eligibility of the players involved and the request’s compliance with the Rules.

## 3.7 Summoner Name Restrictions
For players who qualify for the Regular Season, Summoner Names and Team Names may not contain: vulgarities or obscenities; LoL champion derivatives or other similar character names; or derivatives of products or services that may create confusion.

## 3.8 Name Approval
All Team Tags, Team Names, and Summoner Names must be approved by NACC officials in advance of use in play. Unapproved name changes are not allowed under any circumstances. NACC officials have the ability to deny a team name if it does not reflect the standards sought by the NACC. A team or player will be notified by a NACC official if their name does not meet the standard, and the team will be allowed to change their name.  Players may not change their Summoner names on their main account during the season.

## 3.9 Sponsorships
A NACC team has the ability to acquire sponsors throughout the NACC season. Sponsorship acquisition is unrestricted. However, teams may not acquire “title sponsors,” as teams will solely be represented by their school name and a unique team logo without additional branding.

If the sponsor falls under the ensuing limited categories then the sponsorship may not be displayed by the players during the use or play of LoL, adjacent to LoL related material, the NACC, or any Riot-affiliated events. The NACC officials have the ability to update the category list at any time. The following is a nonexclusive list of limited sponsors:

# 4. League Structure

## 4.1 Definition of Terms
**Game**: An instance of competition on the Summoner’s Rift map that is played until a winner is determined by one of the following methods, whichever occurs first:  (a) Destruction of a Nexus, (b) Team Surrender, (c) Team Forfeit, or (d) Awarded Game Victory (See Section 6.4).

**Match**: A set of games that is played until one team wins a majority of the total games (e.g., winning two games out of three (“best of three”); winning three games out of five (“best of five”)). The winning team will either receive a win tally in a league format or advance to the next round in a bracket format.

## 4.2 Phase Details

### 4.2.1 Open Qualifier.  
This phase consists of a single elimination bracket of up to 512 teams per conference.  Teams who placed in the Top 4 of the 2015 NACC Conference Championships will be seeded into separate quadrants of the bracket.  All other teams will be randomly seeded.

### 4.2.2 Regular Season.
This phase consists of eight teams in a league format against opponents within their conference.  Each team will face each of their opponents twice per split, for a total of fourteen games per team.  Sides will be pre-determined and teams will start on the blue and red sides an equal number of times against each opponent (one game per side). Ranking in the league will be determined by percentage of wins. A full schedule of dates will be made available online.

### 4.2.3 Regular Season Tiebreaker.
In the event that multiple teams are tied in the standings at the conclusion of either Regular Season split (as defined as having the same winning percentage), then any teams so tied will be seeded by head-to-head record. If said teams have identical head-to-head records (as defined as each team winning 50% of games between the two teams), said teams will play one tiebreaker game to determine the final standings.

#### 4.2.3.1 Tiebreaker Schedule.  
Tiebreakers will be played following the final game of the Regular Season, but prior to the first day of the Playoffs. Tied teams will compete against each other until there is a winner.


#### 4.2.3.2 Side Choice.  Side choice is determined by coin flip for all tiebreakers.

#### 4.2.3.3 Head-to-Head Advantage. 
If three or more teams are tied, the head-to-head record of all teams against all other teams involved in the tiebreaker will be considered. If a single team owns a winning record (as defined as winning more than 50% of the games) against every other team in the tiebreaker, they are automatically granted the highest seed available in the tiebreaker, and a new tiebreaker is declared amongst the remaining teams.

#### 4.2.3.4 Tiebreaker methodology.
If no team in a tiebreaker holds a winning record against all other teams, the following structures will be used:

##### 4.2.3.4.1 Three-way tie 
A single round-robin will be played among the three teams. If this does not result in a hierarchical ranking of teams (i.e., distinct 2-0, 1-1, and 0-2 team records), then the three teams will be randomly drawn into a single-elimination bracket where one team has a bye into the finals.

##### 4.2.3.4.2 Four-way tie
The teams will be randomly drawn into a “Korean-style” or “dual” bracket, where teams play Bo1 matches throughout the tournament. The four teams will be split into two first-round matches; the winners will then face off in Game 3 while the losers face off in Game 4. The winner of Game 3 will be declared the top seed; the loser of Game 3 will face the winner of Game 4 in a contest to determine 2nd/3rd place; and the loser of Game 4 will be declared 4th place.

##### 4.2.3.4.3 Five-way tie or greater
The teams will be randomly drawn into a single elimination bracket, with teams randomly receiving byes into the semi-finals as needed.  Additional placement games for placement (e.g. 3rd place  match, 5th place match) may be required.


### 4.2.4 Conference Championships
This phase consists of a two-round, best-of-5 single elimination tournament among the top 4 teams from each conference.  Teams will be seeded based on their Regular Season record and Tiebreakers (if applicable). Side choice will begin with the higher-seeded team and alternate per game.

### 4.2.5 NACC Finals
This phase consists of a two-round, best-of-5 single elimination tournament among the 4 winners from each Conference Championship. Side choice for the first game of each match will be determined by coin flip, then will alternate per game.
